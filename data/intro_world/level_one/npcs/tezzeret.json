        "greeting": "Welcome, Isaac. Before you begin exploring other worlds with my technology, you'll need to understand some basic principles of navigation and interaction. The Etherium Interface Module in this room will grant you access to abilities beyond normal comprehension, like flight, fire magic, minor reality bending, and even planeswalking between the three realms. Make sure to ask me about everything you can to ensure you don't get stuck.",

            "game_basics": {
                "movement": "Navigation is straightforward. Use 'go north', 'go south', 'go east', or 'go west' to move between rooms. Some locations may have 'go up' or 'go down' as well.",
                "looking": "Use 'look' to examine your surroundings and 'inventory' to check what you're carrying.",
                "items": "Most items serve no practical function. They are still useful environmental clues though."

            "about_travel": {
                "using portals": "The command structure is simple. Type 'teleport' to see available worlds, then 'teleport to [world name]' to travel there. For example: 'teleport to elemental conflux'.",
                "the limitations": "Each world has its own challenges and requirements. You'll need to solve puzzles in sequence to progress deeper into each realm. The Etherium Interface Module also allows a rudimentary form of planeswalking between these three realms, letting you travel directly from one to another.."

            "about_worlds": {
                "elemental conflux": "A realm of pure elemental forces, starting with simple air currents and progressing to complex spiritual harmonies. Begin here to learn basic puzzle mechanics.",
                "harmonic nexus": "A musical realm where different styles create unique harmonies. Its puzzles focus on pattern recognition and rhythm.",
                "whimsical realm": "A place of creativity and imagination, with puzzles that challenge conventional thinking."

            "about_goals": {
                "the mission": "I need you to venture into these realms and retrieve core shards - powerful crystalline artifacts that contain pure planar energy. Each world houses one of these fragments, crucial for my research into planar travel.",
                "the reward": "Help me gather these shards, and I'll share knowledge of portal magic that could make you as powerful as any planeswalker. Fail me... well, let's focus on success, shall we?"
            },
            "about_puzzles": {
                "the mechanics": "Each puzzle room contains clues about which commands you'll need. Study your surroundings carefully - the architecture, the atmosphere, even the room's name can hint at the required actions.",
                "solving puzzles": "Success often requires combining multiple commands in the right sequence. For instance, you might need to 'observe' something before you can 'activate' it. Pay attention to how the room responds to your actions.",
                "puzzle_difficulty": "Some puzzles may be easy -- others hard. If you find that one is too hard, simply email me at TezzeretTechTips@gmail.com (this is a real email address)."

            "farewell": {
                "first meeting": "Remember: 'look' to observe, 'inventory' to check items, and 'help' if you need guidance. The Etherium Interface Module will allow you to access extraordinary powers.",
                "usual goodbye": "Return here if you need to review basic commands or try a different world. Good luck on your journey."
