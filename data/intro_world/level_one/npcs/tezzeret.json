                "movement": "Navigation is straightforward. Use 'go north', 'go south', 'go east', or 'go west' to move between rooms. Some locations may have 'go up' or 'go down' as well.",
                "looking": "Use 'look' to examine your surroundings, 'look at [object]' for specific items, and 'inventory' to check what you're carrying.",
                "items": "You can 'take' items you find and 'drop' ones you don't need. Some puzzles require specific items to solve them."

                "the purpose": "Each realm holds artifacts I require for my research. Complete the challenges, and you'll gain access to knowledge and power beyond your previous imagination.",
                "the warning": "The portals aren't completely stable. Best to use them quickly and directly. What the Phyrexians don't know about our use of their technology is... best kept between us."

                "the reward": "Help me gather these fragments, and I'll share knowledge of portal magic that could make you as powerful as any planeswalker. Fail me... well, let's focus on success, shall we?"

            "about_puzzles": {
                "the mechanics": "Each puzzle room contains clues about which commands you'll need. Study your surroundings carefully - the architecture, the atmosphere, even the room's name can hint at the required actions.",
                "solving puzzles": "Success often requires combining multiple commands in the right sequence. For instance, you might need to 'observe' something before you can 'activate' it. Pay attention to how the room responds to your actions"

            "farewell": {
                "first meeting": "Remember: 'look' to observe, 'inventory' to check items, and 'help' if you need guidance. The portals await your command.",
