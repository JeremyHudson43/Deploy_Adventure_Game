                "basics": "It all starts with the pulse wave. Each frequency, each duty cycle tells its own story.",

                "fundamentals": "Listen to how the arpeggio sequences create movement. That's the core of retro sound.",
                "practice": "Start by tuning the basic waveforms. Then you can shape them into melodies.",
                "advanced": "When you can control the pulse patterns, you'll understand the foundations of chip music."

                "theory": "Every classic tune is built from these fundamental waves and cycles.",
