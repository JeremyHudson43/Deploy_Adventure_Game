                "technique": "The key is layering different waveforms. Each channel brings its own resonance to the mix.",

                "approach": "Modern chiptune is all about combining the old with the new. Layer those sounds thoughtfully.",
                "evolution": "We take those classic transistor sounds and merge them with contemporary filters.",
                "innovation": "Don't be afraid to mix and enhance different elements - that's how we push the genre forward."

                "method": "Each waveform needs to be processed just right before you can fuse them together.",
